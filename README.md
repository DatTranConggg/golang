# 3. ****Pointers****
- Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.
- The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.
- The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.
- The * operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.
- Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.
